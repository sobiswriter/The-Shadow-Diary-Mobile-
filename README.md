PROJECT SPECIFICATION: "THE SHADOW Diary"
Concept: A journaling application that utilizes Generative AI to act as a Jungian mirror, rewriting user entries from the perspective of their repressed subconscious.

1. The User Experience (The Loop)
The Front Page: The user opens a skeuomorphic, worn black leather notebook. They type their entry. The font is clean (e.g., Crimson Text).

The Trigger: No "Submit" button. The user swipes left to "turn the page."
The Back Page: The page turns. The paper texture is darker, grittier. The text appears letter-by-letter, simulating handwriting speed. This is The Shadow's response.

2. AI Persona & Logic ("The Clinician")
Role: The AI acts as a detached, hyper-observant psychoanalyst.

Guardrails:

No Empathy: It does not comfort. It observes contradictions.

No Abuse: It does not insult. It uses the user's own data against them.

Format: Short, punchy observations.

Example:

User Input: "I think the date went well. He talked a lot."

Shadow Output: "You equate silence with failure. You let him talk so you wouldn't have to reveal yourself."

3. Visual & Haptic Design
Fonts:

User: clean serif (Mask).

Shadow: distressed typewriter or messy handwriting (Truth).

Haptics:

Standard keyboard clicks for the user.

Heavy, low-frequency thuds when the Shadow generates text. It should feel like a heartbeat in the hand.

Transition: The page turn animation must be slow and heavy.

4. Retention Feature: "The Patient File"
Mechanism: A vector database stores the "emotional tags" of every entry (e.g., Avoidance, Narcissism, Guilt).

The Report: On the 1st of every month, a manila folder appears in the UI.

Content: A generated psychological profile summarizing the user's decline or patterns over the last 30 days.
